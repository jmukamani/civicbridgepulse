```

---

## 5  Docker & Azure Deployment
### 5.1  One-shot build (local)
```bash
docker build -t cbp:latest .
```
The multi-stage Dockerfile builds the React front-end, bundles it into
`server/public`, installs server deps, then starts `node src/index.js` on
port 4000.

### 5.2  Push to Azure & deploy (CLI)
```bash
RG=cap-rg
ACR=capregistry
APP=cap-app-civicbridge

az group create -n $RG -l westeurope
az acr create -g $RG -n $ACR --sku Basic --admin-enabled true
az acr login -n $ACR

docker tag cbp:latest $ACR.azurecr.io/cbp:v1
docker push $ACR.azurecr.io/cbp:v1

az appservice plan create -g $RG -n cap-plan --is-linux --sku B1
az webapp create -g $RG -p cap-plan -n $APP \
  --deployment-container-image-name $ACR.azurecr.io/cbp:v1 \
  --registry-login-server $ACR.azurecr.io \
  --registry-username $(az acr credential show -n $ACR --query username -o tsv) \
  --registry-password $(az acr credential show -n $ACR --query passwords[0].value -o tsv)
```
Visit **https://$APP.azurewebsites.net** – the app is live (see the public
instance at https://cap-app-civicbridge.azurewebsites.net).

### 5.3  GitHub Actions
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` automatically:
1. Builds Docker image on every push to `main`.
2. Pushes to ACR.
3. Deploys image to the Web App using the publish-profile secret.
Add these repo secrets:
* `REGISTRY_USERNAME`, `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` (from ACR)
* `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` (download from App Service → *Get publish profile*)

---

## 6  Offline-first Details
* **Service-Worker** (`client/src/sw.js`)
  * Precaches Vite assets.
  * `NetworkFirst` caches `/api/**` GETs (metadata, comments) for 24 h.
  * `CacheFirst` caches `/uploads/policies/**` plus any other file in
    `/uploads/` (PDF, DOCX, images) for 1 year.
* **Prefetch logic** – When the policy list loads online, it pre-adds each
  PDF and its metadata to the caches so the viewer works offline.
* **Background Sync** – Failed POSTs (issues, messages, etc.) are stored in
  IndexedDB (`idb-keyval`) and replayed when connectivity returns.

---

## 7  Testing
```bash
# backend
cd server && npm test            # Jest + Supertest

# front-end unit
cd ../client && npm test         # RTL / Jest

# end-to-end
npm run test:e2e                 # Playwright
```

---

## 8  npm scripts (root)
| Script | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `npm run dev` (client/server) | Development servers with HMR & nodemon |
| `npm run build` (client)      | Production React build (PWA) |
| `npm run lint`                | ESLint check |
| `npm run test` / `test:e2e`   | Unit & Playwright tests |
